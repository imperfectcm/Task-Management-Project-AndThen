We will guide you through the process of setting up a new project and breaking it down into smaller, manageable tasks.

Step 1: Project Details

2. When will your project start? (Enter the start date in the format YYYY-MM-DD)

Step 2: Task Planning

Great, let's define the tasks for your project.

What is the title of Task 2?
What is the title of Task 3? (Optional, only if you selected 3 or more tasks)
What is the title of Task 4? (Optional, only if you selected 4 or more tasks)

Q6
How many working days will it take to complete Task 1?

Q7

If you answered "No" to the previous question:
